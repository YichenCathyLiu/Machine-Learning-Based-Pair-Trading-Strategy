# Machine-Learning-Based-Pair-Trading-Strategy
In this project, we apply four unsupervised learning clustering methods to categorize SP500 stocks and pinpoint suitable trading pairs within these groups. We follow crucial steps, including data cleaning, dividing it into training and backtesting sets(to avoid cheating!), selecting optimal parameters or clusters, training models, and choosing the best one to achieve the clustering result. Ultimately, we introduce two pair trading strategies and assess their performance by backtesting the selected pairs. This approach aims to enhance the transparency of the trading pair selection process while evaluating the effectiveness of applying unsupervised learning to pair trading.
